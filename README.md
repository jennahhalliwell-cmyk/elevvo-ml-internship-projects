# 🧠 Elevvo Machine Learning Internship Projects

This repository contains the completed tasks from my **1-month internship at Elevvo**, where I explored real-world machine learning and data science projects.  
Each task demonstrates practical implementation, analysis, and evaluation using Python and modern ML libraries.

## 📂 Tasks Completed

### **Task 1 – Student Score Prediction**
Predicts students’ exam scores based on study hours using **Linear Regression**.  
- Dataset: Kaggle Student Scores  
- Techniques: Data visualization, regression modeling, performance evaluation (MSE, R²)  
- Result: *Model accurately predicts performance based on study time.*

### **Task 4 – Loan Approval Prediction**
Predicts whether a loan application will be approved using **Random Forest Classifier**.  
- Dataset: Open-source Loan Approval dataset  
- Techniques: Data cleaning, encoding categorical variables, evaluation with accuracy & confusion matrix  
- Result: *79% accuracy in classifying approved vs. rejected loans.*

### **Task 5 – Movie Recommendation System**
Builds a simple **user-based collaborative filtering** recommendation system.  
- Dataset: MovieLens (Kaggle)  
- Techniques: Similarity metrics, user-item matrix, top-N recommendations  
- Result: *Generates relevant movie suggestions for a given user.*

### **Task 8 – Traffic Sign Recognition**
Classifies traffic sign images using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.  
- Dataset: GTSRB (Kaggle)  
- Techniques: Image preprocessing, CNN modeling with TensorFlow/Keras, accuracy evaluation, confusion matrix  
- Result: *Achieved 67% accuracy on multi-class traffic sign classification.*
